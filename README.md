**📌 Overview**

This project presents a Streamlit-based interactive web application for exploring the Thirukkural, one of the greatest works of Tamil literature by Thiruvalluvar. The system allows users to:

 -Search Kurals by number, topic, or keyword

 -View original Tamil verses with transliteration, English translation

 -Urai Explanations from four scholars(Kalaingar, Parimezhalagar,Varadharajanar,Solomon)

 -Explore moral values derived from each Kural

 -Play interactive quiz games

 -Communicate with an AI chatbot that recommends Kurals based on emotions

 -Bookmark verses, generate summaries, and download them in file format

-The app combines linguistic features, translation tools, and educational gamification to make learning Thirukkural engaging and accessible.

**🎯 Objectives**

 -Build a digital platform to make Thirukkural easily accessible and interactive

 -Provide multiple explanations (Urai) and translations for deeper understanding

 -Enable moral value extraction and thematic search for practical use

 -Incorporate gamified learning (quizzes, puzzles, chatbot)

 -Offer bookmarking, summarization, and downloadable learning material

**🧠 Machine Learning / NLP Components**

Translation & Transliteration: Google translation & IndicTrans2 + Aksharamukh

Topic & Keyword Search: String matching + semantic search features

Emotion-aware Chatbot: Suggests relevant Kurals based on user’s mood/emotion

Summarization: Auto-generates short moral stories and summaries for each Kural

**📈 Features Implemented**

Today’s Kural: Daily inspiration with moral takeaway

Kural Lookup: Search by number, word, or topic

Multiple Urais: Explanations from 4 scholars

Moral Extraction: Short moral values highlighted per verse

Bookmarking System: Save, view, and download selected Kurals

Topic Search: By numbers, words, and themes

Quiz Games: Missing word, matching, topic puzzles, Tamil keyword grid

Chatbot Integration: Conversational interface with emotion-based Kural suggestions

Summary & Downloads: Auto-generated summaries with export option

**🌐 Web Application Stack**

Backend: Python, Streamlit

Frontend: Streamlit widgets (Python-driven UI)

ML/NLP Libraries: IndicTrans2, Aksharamukha, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Other Tools: gTTS for audio, WordCloud for visualization

**🚧 Challenges**

Handling Tamil language complexities (encoding, font rendering, transliteration)

Mapping each Kural to multiple categories (Athigaram, Porutpaal, Inbathupaal)

Integrating translations and multiple Urais consistently

Designing gamified features within Streamlit’s simple interface

Balancing accuracy of translation with readability

**🚀 Future Work**

Expand to multi-language support for Urai and translations

Incorporate advanced semantic search (vector embeddings)

Improve chatbot with generative AI and memory-based conversations

Add audio narration of Urai explanations

Mobile app version with offline access
